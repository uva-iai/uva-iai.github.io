# Universiteit Van Amsterdam Inclusive AI

## UVA Inclusive AI invites Shakir Mohamed
We invite everybody that is studying, teaching, and researching AI at the University of Amsterdam to join a virtual talk and discussion with Shakir Mohamed (Google DeepMind) on Decolonial AI and Sociotechnical Foresight.

The talk and discussion will take place on the 26th of October 2020, 15:00, via Zoom [link](https://uva-live.zoom.us/j/89025891407)


In order to avoid Zoombombing, you need a UVA email address to participate.


We chose to use the webinar format. After and during the talk participants can enter questions via the chat and vote on questions. We will then enable the video and audio of the person that authored the question. Please consider reading his latest work before the talk:

[Decolonial AI: Decolonial Theory as Sociotechnical Foresight in Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04068)

CALL FOR QUESTIONS

In addition, we encourage everybody to prepare and submit questions for Shakir to info.uva.iai@gmail.com during the next week. 

## Statement on UVA IAI

The UvA Instituut voor Informatica is the proud home of an Inclusive AI (IAI) community for the Master's programme AI. The IAI is an inclusive space for members to get non-academic help from senior peers in the field and connect with like-minded people of a similar background. Our goal is to directly combat the infamous leaky pipeline found in academia.

## Code of Conduct
1. Privacy is important to us. Do not share details about others that they have not explicitly made public. This includes, but is not limited to, sexuality, gender, medical conditions, housing, relationships or financial status.
2. Aggression and elitism are unwelcome - knowledge is not a competition. After all you are here to support each other, so do that whenever you can.
3. Do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behaviour. Do not make jokes related to these either. Use people’s preferred pronouns (don't be afraid to ask).
4. Harassment will not be tolerated in any form. Under no circumstances should a mentor be romantically involved with their mentee. Should romantic feelings develop nonetheless, we will reassign mentor and mentee.
5. We take collective responsibility for making all members feel welcome and agree to act accordingly.


## Mentorship
We currently offer a mentorship scheme for students of the UvA AI masters program. 

Mentees should expect to be able to:

- ask their mentor for practical advice, e.g. how to write a CV or motivation letter, where to apply for jobs, when to apply for PhDs
- network with other students
- seek non-academic advice from their mentor
- learn how to present their research
- connect with other researchers

Mentees are expected to:

- Adhere to the UvA-IAI code of conduct

We have taken inspiration from organisations such as Black in AI, Women in ML, Queer in AI, Latinx in ML, and Jews in ML, which all aim to celebrate diversity and foster participation from underrepresented groups in AI. The IAI establishes a similar space for students of AI Master at the UvA.

I am a postdoc in Max Welling’s new Philips group at the UvA. I did my PhD at UCL in the Machine Vision Group. Before that I studied engineering at The University of Cambridge, and am a scholar of Sidney Sussex College. I am currently lecturing Probability Theory for Machine Learning, and am the lab manager for the Philips lab at the UvA.

My research focuses on generalizing convolution, approximate Bayesian inference, optimization, uncertainty quantification, and medical imaging.
