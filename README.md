# Universiteit Van Amsterdam Inclusive AI

## Statement on UVA IAI

We are proud to announce that the UvA Instituut voor Informatica is opening a new Inclusive AI (IAI) community. The purpose of the IAI is to build a long-lasting community where members can connect with like-minded people of a similar background and help each other in an environment, where they may feel more at ease. 

We have taken inspiration from organisations such as Inclusion in ML, Black in AI, Women in ML, Queer in ML, and Latinx in ML, which all aim to celebrate diversity and foster participation from underrepresented groups in AI. The IAI establishes a similar such space for students of the KI Bachelor and AI Master at the UvA, focussing on:

- female students, 
- racial and ethnic minority students, 
- economically and academically disadvantaged students, 
- LGBTQ+ students, 
- students with disabilities.

## Mailing list

We created a [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/uva-iai) that you can join to stay uptodate with our activities.

### Karen Ullrich
<img src="images/karen.jpg" alt="alt text" width="200" height="200" align="left" hspace="20">
I am a Ph.D. student at Uo Amsterdam, supervised by Prof. Max Welling and alumni of the Austrian Research Institute for AI, Intelligent Music Processing and Machine Learning Group lead by Prof. Gerhard Widmer. I studied Physics and Numerical Simulations in Leipzig and Amsterdam.

My research focus lies in machine learning. In particular, I am interested in statistical inference, information theory, deep learning, Bayesian methods, geometric methods and graph theory. I apply techniques of the aforementioned to problems in structural and systems biology, compression, sequential data (e.g. music, environmental data) and real-time sensoring.
